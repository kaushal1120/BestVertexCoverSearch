Iterative Deepening:
1. The main function in java file IterativeDeepening.java in package ai.bestvertexcover.search runs the Iterative Deepening algorithm.
2. The input for iterative deepening is defined in BestVertexCoverSearch-master/src/input_files/iterativedeepening_input.txt. Replace the contents
of this input file to run iterative deepening for any other input.

Hill Climbing:
1. The main function in java file HillClimbing.java in package ai.bestvertexcover.search runs the Hill Climbing algorithm.
